# Large-Language-Models

## Overview

This project utilizes LLaMA-2, a robust and flexible language model, as the basis for developing a specialized Large Language Model (LLM) designed for a medical AI chatbot. The process involves fine-tuning this model using a dataset containing over 5,000 medical questions and answers. Each step of this development is essential to guarantee the model's precision, relevance, and safety. 

## Steps: 
1. **Dataset Preparation**
Initiate the process with a comprehensive dataset of over 5,000 medical questions and answers, ensuring it is clean, of high quality, and reflective of the diverse range of inquiries the chatbot will encounter. Organize the dataset so that each entry pairs a medical question with its corresponding answer, optimizing it for effective training.

2. **Environment Setup**
Choose Vast.ai for the training infrastructure, as training Large Language Models (LLMs) demands substantial computational resources, typically requiring robust GPUs or TPUs. Cloud computing offers a versatile and scalable solution for such demands. Prepare the environment with Python, specifically utilizing PyTorch and Transformers libraries for data preprocessing and model evaluation tasks.

3. **Model Fine-Tuning**
Begin with the pre-trained LLaMA-2 model, setting its hyperparameters—like learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs—to tailor the fine-tuning process. Employ the curated dataset to fine-tune LLaMA-2, training it to specifically adjust its weights to excel in the medical questions and answers domain. This step is crucial for enhancing the model's ability to generate accurate and relevant responses within this specific field.
